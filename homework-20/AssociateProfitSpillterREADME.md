The Associate Profit Splitter Contract:

Executed under this contract address: 0x7A18a1f327DE55480d62225C9aD4713aD0EDCbBE

I had difficult with depositing currency in the employee accounts after deploying the contract. The transaction was continuously rejected, and I think it may have something to do with the fallback function.
